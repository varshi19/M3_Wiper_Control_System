# Abstract

A windshield wiper is a device that cleans the front window of a car by removing rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, and water. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, lorries, buses, railroad locomotives, and watercraft with a cabin—as well as some aircraft—have one or more such wipers, which are usually required by law. The previous technology needed manual wiper activation; adjusting the frequency results in a variable operation of raising the wiper speed. This project seeks to improve the system of older cars by providing automated wiping, to improve the system by using a sensor with actuators, and to build a basic software that will completely work with the system. This proposed wiper system's principle is comparable to those of other existing conventional wipers.Despite removing water from the windscreen, this system also will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a Peripheral Interface Controller
