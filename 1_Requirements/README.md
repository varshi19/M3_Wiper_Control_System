# WipercontrolSystem

# INTRODUCTION
  The operational speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it.
# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
 STM32 CUBE IDE
# COMPONENTS
  STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
## DESCRIPTION
# STM32F407VG
 The STM32F407  Kit takes advantage of the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers' capabilities to make it simple for users to create audio-based applications. It comes with an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, an ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a USB OTG micro-AB connector.Ethernet connectivity, an LCD display, and other features have been added to the STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built around the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core, which runs at up to 168 MHz.
 # FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
  * In a LQFP100 package, the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller has a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM.
  * On-board ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A on STM32F4 DISCOVERY (old reference) or STM32F407G-DISC1 (new order code)
  * USB ST-LINK with three separate interfaces and re-enumeration capability.
  * Virtual Com port Debug port (with new order code only)
  * Large-scale storage (with new order code only)
  * Board power is supplied through USB or an external 5 V supply source.
  * 3 V and 5 V external application power supply
 # USES
  * This Microcontroller is utilised in printing and scanning machines ,heat ventilation, air conditioning, and security systems. 
  * This module can be found in a variety of household products.
 # WORKING PRINCIPLE
  Consider the automobile as microcontroller. If the button is hit, the first LED (red) will turn on. Pressing the button again the wiper will start and the second LED (blue) will turn on for the desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third LED (green) will turn on and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth LED (orange) and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.

 # WHAT IS WIPER SYSTEM
  Windscreen wipers are necessary for maintaining sufficient view for the driver, especially in modern high-speed cars.
 # WHY WIPER SYSTEM
   To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times.
 # WHEN SHOULD USE WIPER SYSTEM 
  The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
 # WHO DISCOVERED WIPER SYSTEM
  Mark Anderson invented on 1902
 # HOW
The control system includes a rain sensor which detects the rain condition. An analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions has been identified.A converter is used to convert analog signal into digital pulse signal and is transferred to a digital circuit system.The pulse signal is digitally processed where a control signal is produced.The control signal is applied to a wiper driver circuit to adjust the operational speed or timing in accordance with the control signal.
